AAS WorldWide Telescope isn’t just a [Windows application][windows-client] or
a [JavaScript library][webgl-engine] — it’s a complex ecosystem of software,
data, and web services. This guide attempts to give a picture of the
architecture of this ecosystem and document its components that don’t have
their own freestanding manuals.
